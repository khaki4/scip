Rules have parts: a left handside and right handside (replacement)

```
          rule
Pattern --------> skeleton
```

- pattern : something that matches
- skeleton : something you susbtitute into an expression in order to get a new expression

Pattern match:
```
foo     -> matches exactly foo
(f a b) -> matches any list whose first element is f
                                  second element is a
                                  third element is b
(? x)   -> matches anything, call it x
(?c x)  -> matches a constant, call it x
(?v x)  -> matches a variable, call it x
```

Skeletons:
```
foo       -> instantiates to itself
(foo a b) -> instantiates to a list of 3 elements which is the result of instanciating each
             of f, a and b
(: x)     -> instantiates to the value of x as in the matched pattern
```

Simplifier:
```
foo       -> instantiates to itself
(foo a b) -> instantiates to a list of 3 elements which is the result of instanciating each
             of f, a and b
(: x)     -> instantiates to the value of x as in the matched pattern
```
