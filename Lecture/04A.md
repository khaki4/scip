Rules have parts: a left handside and right handside (replacement)

```
          rule
Pattern --------> skeleton
```

- pattern : something that matches
- skeleton : something you susbtitute into an expression in order to get a new expression

Pattern match:
```
foo     -> matches exactly foo
(f a b) -> matches any list whose first element is f
                                  second element is a
                                  third element is b
(? x)   -> matches anything, call it x
(?c x)  -> matches a constant, call it x
(?v x)  -> matches a variable, call it x
```

Skeletons:
```
foo       -> instantiates to itself
(foo a b) -> instantiates to a list of 3 elements which is the result of instantiating each
             of f, a and b
(: x)     -> instantiates to the value of x as in the matched pattern
```

Simplifier:
```
foo       -> instantiates to itself
(foo a b) -> instantiates to a list of 3 elements which is the result of instantiating each
             of f, a and b
(: x)     -> instantiates to the value of x as in the matched pattern
```

Each rule is a pair with a pattern and a skeleton

The patterns from the rules are fed into a matcher.
The matched passes a dictionary (x was matched against a given sub expression) to the instantiator
The instantiator receives the skeletons from the rules.
The new expressions produced by the instantiator are fed back into the matcher.
The while process is recursive, until nothing changes.

matcher(expression, pattern, dictionary) -> new dictionary

```scheme
(define (match pat exp dict)
  (cond ((eq? dict 'failed) 'failed')
        ((atom? pat)
            **** Atmoic patterns)
        **** Pattern variables clauses
        ((atom? exp) 'failed)
        (else
          (match (cdr pat)
                 (cdr exp)
                 (match (car pat) (car exp dict)))))
```

Example of expression matching:

```scheme
(+ (* (?x) (?y)) (?y))
(+ (*   3    x)    x)

=> produces the dictionary {x => 3, y = 'x}


((atom? pat)
  (if (atom? exp)
    (if (eq? pat exp)
      dict
      'failed)
  'failed'))


((arbitrary-constant? pat)
  (if (constant? exp)
    (extend-dict pat exp dict)
    'failed))

((arbitrary-variable? pat)
  (if (variable? exp)
    (extend-dict pat exp dict)
    'failed))

((arbitrary-expression? pat)
  (extend-dict pat exp dict))
```

instanciator(dict, skel) -> expr
```scheme
; recursive tree walk of the skeleton
(define (instantiate skel dict)
  (define (loop s)
    (cond ((atom? s) s)
          ((skeleton-evaluation? s)
           (evaluate (eval-exp s) dict))
         (else (const (loop (car s) (cdr s))))))
(loop skel))


(define (evaluate form dict)
  (if (atom? form)
    (lookup form dict)
    (apply
      (eval (lookup (car form) dict) user-initial-environment)
      (mapcar (lambda (v) (lookup v dict)) (cdr form)))))
```

Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) simplifier

```scheme
; Returns a procedure for the given set of rules
(define (simplifier the-rules)
  (define (simplify-exp exp)
    ...)
  (define (simplify-parts exp)
    ...)
  (define (try-rules exp)
    ...)
  simplify-exp
)

(define (simplify-exp exp)
  (try-rules (if (compound? exp)
    (simplify-parts exp)
    exp)))

(define (simplify-parts exp)
  (if (null? exp)
    '()
    (cons (simplify-exp (car exp))
          (simplify-exp (cdr exp)))))


; Other idiom
(define (simplify-exp exp)
  (try-rules
    (if (compound? exp)
      (map simplify-exp exp)
      exp
    )))

(define (try-rules exp)
  (define (scan rules)
    ...)
  (scan the-rules))

(define (scan rules)
  (if (null? rules)
    exp
    (let ((dict
            (match (pattern (car rules)) exp (empty-dictionary))))
      (if (eq? dict 'failed)
        (scan (cdr rules))
        (simplify-exp
            (instantiate
              (skeleton (car rules))
              dict))))))

(define (empty-dictionary) '())

(define (extend-dictionary pat dat dict)
  (let ((name (variable-name pat)))
    (let ((v (assq name dict)))
      (cond ((null? v)
        (cons (list name dat) dict))
        ((eq? (cadr v) dat) dict)
        (else 'failed)))))

(define (lookup var dict)
