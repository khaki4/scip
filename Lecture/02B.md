# Building Abstractions with Data

We also saw that higher-order procedures enhance the power of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason in terms of, general methods of computation. This is much of the essence of programming.

```scheme
(define (add-rat x y)
  (make-rat 
    (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
      (* (number y) (denom x)))
    (* (denom x) (denom y))))


(define (mul-rat x y)
  (make-rat
    (* (numer x) (numer y))
    (* (denom x) (denom y))))
```
