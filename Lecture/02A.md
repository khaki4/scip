> **Sum int from a to b**
```lisp
(define (sum-int a b) 
  (if (> a b)
    0
    (+ a 
    (sum-int (1+ a) b))))
``` 

> **Sum square from a to b**
```lisp
(define (sum-sq a b)
  (if (> a b)
    0
    (+ (sum-sq a)
      (sum-sq (1+ a) b))))
```

these programs are almost identical. the same predicate and the same consequent, and alternatives are very similar, too.
**Whenever trying to make complicated systems and understand them, it's crucial to divide the thins up into as many pieces as I can, each of which I understand separately.**

```lisp
(define (SUM TERM A NEXT B)
  (IF (> A B)
    0
    (+ (TERM A)
      (SUM TERM 
        (NEXT A)
        NEXT
        B))))
